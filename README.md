# SongNation
I am very happy to share the setup of my music streaming desktop application. I have made it using Python, Javascript, CSS, and HTML  and this is my first application by the way. 
You can download and listen to your favorite songs for free, isn't that amazing! Try downloading it and I am sure you'll not regret using it.
