# SongNation
I am very happy to share the setup of my music streaming desktop application. I have made it using Python, Javascript, CSS, and HTML  and this is my first application by the way. 
You can download and listen to your favorite songs for free, isn't that amazing! Try downloading it and I am sure you'll not regret using it.
If you face issues like dll missing then also download vc_redist.x64.exe, it is Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable 64bit which helps running the application SongNation.
